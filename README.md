 # OpenBOR
OpenBOR is a continuation of the Beats Of Rage 2D game engine, which was originally
created by the wonderful folks over at http://www.senileteam.com. 


## History
In 2004, Senile Team released Beats of Rage, a free beat-'em-up for DOS inspired
by SEGA's Streets of Rage series and using sprites from SNK Playmore's King of
Fighters series.  The game spread only by word of mouth, but it nonetheless
amassed popularity very quickly.  Senile Team soon released an edit pack allowing
anyone interested to create a mod for the BOR engine.

In 2005, Kirby2000 asked Senile Team to open the source code to BOR.  They
agreed, and OpenBOR was born.  Development on the engine was continued by the
community, and still is to this day.

## Platforms
OpenBOR has a very modular and portable design inherited from Beats of Rage - several ports have been made available.

### Current
These platforms are actively supported and may be compiled with the latest OpenBOR engine.

* Android
* Windows
* Linux
* Mac OS X
* Wii
* PSP

### Discontinued

The following platforms are still available as legacy binaries, but are no longer supported and may not be compatible with current iterations of OpenBOR.

* Dreamcast
* GP2X
* GP2X Wiz
* OpenDingux (Dingoo A320 & GCW-Zero)

## OpenBOR Team

### Current Members

#### Damon Caskey (2007-)
OpenBOR project manager and site owner of the OpenBOR community. Primary
contributions are core engine and scripting development, code cleanup, and organization. Main focus is keeping OpenBOR future proof and modular by replacing specialized hardcoding and overlap with generalized features that allow for more author creativity.

#### Plombo (2009-)
A developer who prefers to work on OpenBOR's supporting libraries and
platform-specific backends.  Known for maintaining the Wii port, writing the
GPU-accelerated video code for Wii and OpenGL, and a few engine features.

#### White Dragon (2016-)
A long time module author and extremely knowledgeable coder who joined the development team in 2016 and immediately began making an impact. White Dragon generally focuses on level and menu properties, but has branched out into various other facets of the engine over time.

### Former members and contributors

#### uTunnels (2007-2014)
Among many other powerful additions, contributed the original scripting engine to OpenBOR, single handedly
breaking nearly every single limitation module authors faced. While not officially retired, uTunnels presence became gradually more infrequent before stopping altogether in early 2014.
